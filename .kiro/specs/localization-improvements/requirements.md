# Polban Localization System Improvements - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for improving the Polban website localization system. The main goal is to fix existing issues and create a complete, functional localization system that allows users to switch between English and Persian languages with full RTL support.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Language Switcher in User Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to switch the website language between English and Persian so that I can view content in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user opens the website THEN language switcher button SHALL be visible in the header
2. WHEN user clicks on language switcher button THEN language selection menu SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN user selects Persian language THEN all texts SHALL be translated to Persian
4. WHEN user selects English language THEN all texts SHALL be translated to English
5. WHEN user changes language THEN their selection SHALL be saved in localStorage
6. WHEN user reopens the website THEN their last selected language SHALL be loaded

### Requirement 2: Implementation of data-translate attributes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all HTML texts to be marked with data-translate attributes so that the localization system can identify and translate them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN page loads THEN all text elements SHALL have data-translate attributes
2. WHEN localization system runs THEN all elements with data-translate SHALL be identified
3. WHEN language changes THEN content of all elements with data-translate SHALL be updated
4. IF element doesn't have data-translate THEN its content SHALL not change
5. WHEN translation for a key doesn't exist THEN default text SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 3: Complete localization.js file

**User Story:** As a system, I want the JavaScript localization file to be complete so that I can perform all translation and language switching operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN localization.js file loads THEN all required functions SHALL be available
2. WHEN init() function is called THEN localization system SHALL be initialized
3. WHEN loadTranslations() function runs THEN JSON translation files SHALL be loaded
4. WHEN createLanguageSwitcher() function runs THEN language switcher button SHALL be created
5. WHEN updateElements() function runs THEN all elements with data-translate SHALL be updated
6. WHEN applyLanguage() function is called THEN new language SHALL be applied

### Requirement 4: Complete RTL Support

**User Story:** As a Persian-speaking user, I want the page layout to change to right-to-left (RTL) when I select Persian language so that I have a proper user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Persian language is selected THEN dir="rtl" attribute SHALL be added to html
2. WHEN RTL mode is activated THEN all texts SHALL be right-aligned
3. WHEN RTL mode is activated THEN navigation menu SHALL be arranged from right to left
4. WHEN RTL mode is activated THEN Persian fonts (Vazirmatn, IRANSansX) SHALL be applied
5. WHEN RTL mode is activated THEN animations and transitions SHALL be adjusted for RTL
6. WHEN English language is selected THEN LTR mode SHALL be restored

### Requirement 5: Meta Tags Update

**User Story:** As a search engine, I want page meta tags to be updated based on user's selected language so that I have proper SEO.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN language changes THEN page title SHALL be updated to new language
2. WHEN language changes THEN meta description SHALL be updated to new language
3. WHEN language changes THEN meta keywords SHALL be updated to new language
4. WHEN language changes THEN lang attribute in html SHALL be updated
5. WHEN Persian language is selected THEN dir="rtl" SHALL be added to html
6. WHEN English language is selected THEN dir="ltr" SHALL be added to html

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Fallback

**User Story:** As a system, I want to have proper fallback in case of errors loading translations so that users can still use the website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSON translation files fail to load THEN fallback translations SHALL be used
2. WHEN translation for specific key doesn't exist THEN default text SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN error occurs in localization system THEN error SHALL be logged to console
4. WHEN localization system doesn't work THEN website SHALL still be usable
5. IF language saved in localStorage is invalid THEN default language (English) SHALL be used
6. WHEN browser doesn't support localStorage THEN default language SHALL be used

### Requirement 7: Testing and Debug Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper testing and debug tools for the localization system so that I can quickly identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test_localization.html file is opened THEN all localization features SHALL be testable
2. WHEN debug_localization.html file is opened THEN debug information SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN test buttons are clicked THEN system performance SHALL be verifiable
4. WHEN error occurs THEN error details SHALL be displayed in debug panel
5. WHEN localization system initializes THEN its status SHALL be logged to console
6. WHEN translations are loaded THEN number of loaded keys SHALL be reported

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want language switching to be fast and without delay so that I have a smooth user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN translations are loaded THEN they SHALL be loaded only once at the beginning
2. WHEN language changes THEN changes SHALL be applied in less than 300ms
3. WHEN page loads THEN localization system SHALL be ready in less than 500ms
4. WHEN JSON files are loaded THEN they SHALL be loaded asynchronously and in parallel
5. WHEN user changes language multiple times THEN performance SHALL not degrade
6. WHEN RTL animations run THEN they SHALL be smooth and without lag

## Technical Constraints

- System must be compatible with modern browsers (Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+)
- Translation files should not exceed 100KB in size
- System must work without dependencies on external libraries
- Support for keyboard navigation for accessibility

## Success Criteria

- All texts display correctly in both languages
- Language switching completes in less than 300ms
- RTL layout is completely correct
- Automated tests pass 100%
- No JavaScript errors exist in console
